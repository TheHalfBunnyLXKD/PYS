# The amount of time (in ticks) a stage will stay in frame.
# The animation will change frame in two instances:
# 1. If we are proceeding to the next animation stage
# 2. If we are repeating a frame (Seen in animation stage 2)
# This can be defined per stage. If it's not, then this is used as a global value.

# If it's just R (or the symbol you defined) then the item will become a different random reward every refreshed inventory case

# Will show up as a closed_select_reward_item, which will be a clickable item slot, after clicking it the item will become selected_reward_item, use the open_selected_reward_symbol to show the reward after this stage.

# Selected ->reveal<- reward configuration acts differently than the select_reward_symbol configuration.
# Please read the reveal_reward_symbol explanation first
# The main difference is that after the user clicks on reveal_reward_symbol, you can then place the selected revealed items in any position, no matter where they were clicked before, meanwhile
# The select_reward_symbol is bound to the exact slot where the user had clicked and can not be moved to a different position in the other stages

# When Should The Crate auto_close (in ticks (1 second = 20 ticks)), this is for screens like click to accept the reward or for screens where you need to click on a tile to reveal the reward.
# But if the user takes too long it will simply auto open it for him.
