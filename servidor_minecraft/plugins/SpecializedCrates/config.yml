# How would you to store player statistics? Current options: FLATFILE, PLAYERFILES
# FLATFILE: Every player's data is stored in one single file.
# PLAYERFILES: Every player has their own file that stores their data.
# MYSQL: Use a database to store information. Use the MySQL.yml file to setup database info.
store-data: FLATFILE

# What plugin status messages would you like to be logged into console?
# Options:
#  EVERYTHING - Logs successful loads and failed loads.
#  FAILURES - Logs all loading failures.
#  NOTHING - Logs nothing at all to console.
log-successes: FAILURES

# When should player data be saved when using the FLATFILE data handler?
#   Options: DISABLE, INTERVAL
#   DISABLE: Player data is saved when the plugin is disabled (server stopped, reload, restart). This
#     is the MOST efficient and least resource consuming but will result in data loss on crashes.
#   INTERVAL: Player data is saved on an interval specified by 'data-save-interval' and ALSO when
#     the plugin is disabled (server stopped, reload, restart). The player data is only saved on the
#     interval if there has been a change. If nothing has been written to the file, it is not saved.
#     This is the LEAST efficient method as a file is periodically saved to disk but is safest and is
#     unlikely to lose data on crashes
flatfile-save-method: INTERVAL

# What should the interval, in SECONDS, be to save the player data?
#   Note: If there is no new player data to save, it won't save - the interval is to check IF
#   there is new information to be saved, and, if so, to save it.
flatfile-save-interval: 300

# What amount of history be kept for the player?
#
# Set to -1 to keep all player history and anything above that to keep that amount of most recent
#   history data for a player. (i.e. if it was set to 20, the last 20 crates worth of data for a
#   player would be kept - anything beyond that would be purged).
#
# Why purge old crate history data? The more data the player has to their name, the longer it takes
#   to load their history, the more server resources that are consumed every time a player joins.

# Should the console receive Success, Error messages
